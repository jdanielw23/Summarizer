C. Fuel Quantity Indicating System
l. General Description
a. The FUEL QUANTITY "MASTER" INDICATOR is part of a
capacitance bridge circuit which includes a network of capacitors in the tank. This capacitor network contains one GAGING COMPENSATOR in each tank, and as many as eleven TANK UNITS. Each main tank circuit includes a fueling VOLUMETRIC TOPOFF UNIT, and one or two VOLUMETRIC TOPOFF COMPENSATORS.
b. The "master" indicator measures the tank unit capacitance
to determine the weight of fuel in the tank. This measurement is shared with the volumetric topoff unit in the ma in tank Circuit . The in di Cator al So measures the capacitance of the gaging compensator to correct for deviations caused by the composition of the fuel from average fuel.

The "master" indicator sends a voltage signal, proportional to the tank fuel weight, to the "REPEATER." INDICATOR on the FUELING PANEL, Pl5. The sometimes, optional total fuel quantity indication receives this same voltage signal from each "master" indicator for Summation .
Test Switches check indicator and System operation, not accuracy. A TEST GAGES switch on the Flight Engineer's FUEL PANEL, disabled during fueling, should cause each "master" indicator pointer to move downscale, and the total quantity indication to move upscale. A TEST GAGES switch on the fueling panel also checks the indicators. This test switch causes signals that should result in the "repeater" indicator pointers moving downscale. The "master" indicators normally move upscale during this test and the total quantity indication moves downscale. The test switch on the fueling panel also tests the volumetric topoff units by causing the main tank "master" indicators to send a simulated full-tank signal through the tank unit circuit. This test should close any open main tank FUELING WALWE.
TANK UNITS are tubular capacitors in the fuel quantity capacitor network. The tank units are mounted nearly vertically in a precise, through apparently random pattern throughout the tank. The tank unit length (i.e., height) is almost wing-skin to wing-skin. The inner tube has a pattern of cylindrical sections of changing diameter and length along its height. The outer tube is a cylinder of constant diameter. The profiling and placement of the tank units, related to tank shape, assures a correct relationship between fuel covered plate area and fuel volume.
Each tank unit is unique and indexed in a specific position or symmetrically opposite position. The tank units, if more than one, are wired in parallel via the TANK UNIT CONNECTOR ASSEMBLY (CABLE) and the volumetric topoff unit baseplate. The tank unit arrangement assures accuracy over a wide range of airplane attitudes, maneuvers and wing deflections because several tank units are wetted. The Outboard two tank units in tanks l and 3 are paralleled in the tank to avoid the need to enlarge the hole and connector in the spar.
The tank units measure fuel weight in terms of fuel Dielectric Constant and proportion of network capacitor plate area covered by fuel. The Dielectric Constant of the fuel varies with temperature in nearly the same proportion that specifif weight (den sity, or specific gravity) varies. The tank unit capacitor network plate area covered by fuel is in proportion to fuel thermal expansion or contraction, inversely proportional to the Dielectric Constant Variation.

The gaging Compensators are tubular capacitors mounted low in the tank, near the Sump level. The gaging compensators measure the fuel Dielectric Constant to assure a correct relationship between the fuel Dielectric Constant and the fuel specific weight. This improves "master" indicator accuracy.
A VOLUMETRIC TOPOFF UNIT is part of each main tank fueling shutoff circuit. Using the fuel quantity indicating system for fueling control allows maximum usage of tank available volume by taking advantage of the multiple sensors in the main tank capacitor network. This reduces errors due to airplane attitude changes and wing deflection on the full-tank shutoff level.
The volumetric topoff units are mounted on the inboard wing front spar and form part of the fuel tight tank wall connector. The volumetric topoff unit measures the capacitance of the volumetric topoff compensator to determine the specific weight of the fuel in the tank during fueling. The unit then calculates the weight of fuel that would be a full main tank. The volumetric topoff unit also measures tank unit capacitance to determine the actual weight of fuel in the tank. When the actual fuel weight equals the calculated full-volume, the volumetric topoff unit closes the fueling valve. Unfortunately, the weight signal also equals the calculated weight signal when the tank is empty or nearly empty. This is the reason the main tank fueling valves will not open if the tank is empty or nearly empty.
When the Volumetric Topoff Unit closes a main tank fueling valve at full rated volume, it electrically locks the valve circuit closed so that Slosh and wave action will not cause the valve to cycle open/close after initial shutoff. This lock-out circuit is the reason, with a near-full tank, the fueling valve will not open by the fueling valve switch. It is also the reason for not using the fueling panel gage test switch when the tank is nearly full. This lock-out circuit is also involved with the nearly-empty valve close signals.
The fueling valves, in lockout, can be opened by following the procedures on one of the fueling placards or by operating the manual override handle on the valves. Manual operation of a valve requires that its circuit be de-energized. The most convenient way to override the valve-Close and lock-out circuit is to use the volumetric topoff reset switches.

m. The VOLUMETRIC TOPOFF COMPENSATORS are tubular capacitors
mounted low in the tanks, usually near the Sump level. Main tanks No. 1 and No. 3 each have a second volumetric topoff compensator that is mounted outboard several rib-bays and slightly higher. The volumetric topoff Compensators measure the fue Dielectric Constant to determine the fuel weight for the volumetric topoff unit calculation of full main tank weight for the rated full volume capacity of the tank. These compensators also have a correcting function Similar to the gaging compensators.
n. Tanks l and 3 have two compensators to help average the
effects of fuel in-the-tank with fuel being added during fueling. The two compensators minimize the effect of fuel stratification. The inboard compensators in tanks No. 1 and No. 3 also have washing lines to improve this averaging.
o. Tank 2 has a VOLUMETRIC TOPOFF (PADDING) CAPACITOR to
make the wiring capacitance more like TANK 1 & 3. This capacitor is mounted in the left inboard wing leading edge, near the tank 2 volumetric topoff unit.
p. During fueling, the COMPENSATOR WASHING LINE jet of fuel
causes local mixing to reduce the effects of fuel stratification and fuel type differences on the full-tank Shutoff level and gaging accuracy. This washing action tends to remove water that may not have been removed by Sump drain procedures.
q. The fuel quantity indicators and volumetric topoff units
have adjustments. These are: empty and full on each "master" indicator, full on each "repeater" indicator, empty and each active channel of the total fuel indication, calibration (full tank shutoff) and trim on the volumetric topoff units. The indicator adjustments are shopset and sealed. It is intended that only the tank unit trimmer capacitor be adjusted when changing any precalibrated indicator. -
r. Proper Sump drainage remains extremely important for proper volumetric topoff operation and fuel quantity indicating system accuracy.
S. MEASURING STICKS are for manual measurement of main tank
fuel quantity. The graduated fiberglass tubes, stowed in the lower wing surface, measure fuel by locating the height of the fuel surface.

3. Fuel Quantity Circuit
d.
The bridge transformer in the FUEL QUANTITY "MASTER" INDICATOR applies a fixed voltage to the TANK UNIT circuit. The resulting current is sensed by the VOLUMETRIC TOPOFF UNIT SHUTOFF RELAY amplifier and the "master" indicator SERVO amplifier as a voltage drop across impedences of the amplifier inputs. Fuel added to the tank will increase this current in proportion to the weight of fuel. The E (Empty) potentiometer of the bridge transformer applies a fixed, but adjustable, voltage to the EMPTY REF (reference) capacitor. The Current, in a proper ly adjusted ind i Cator, is equal in magnitude to the dry tank unit current, but of opposite instantaneous polarity and is sensed at the servo amplifier input. For a nulled empty tank bridge, the SERVO motor has no choice but to run the BAL POT (balance or rebalance potentiometer) pickoff to a zero-volts position. Ideally, this is also the zero weight graduation of the dial.
The two current paths, sensing and balance, are completed to the bridge transformer center tap (i.e.; AC zero) through the current LIMITER. Normally, the limiter offers no impedance to the AC current since the normal AC mdulates the forward DC bias below the limit of diode operation.
When a ground occurs on any wire between a bridge transformer and the tank units or compensators, the limiter diodes are alternately reverse - biased to cutoff when the AC instantaneous polarity exceeds the DC forward bias. When each limiter diode is in Cutoff, the Circuit is still complete, but through high-impedance resistors bypassing the diodes. These resistors, in series with the bridge transformer, limit the current to 10 Ma, a safe, explosion-proof level. Current limiters are in all "master" and "repeater" indicators and in the volumetric topoff units.
When fuel is added to the tank, the increased current in the tank unit circuit upsets null and causes an amplifier output to one phase of the servo motor. The amplifier Output leads (or lags) the reference phase by 900 such that if the tank unit current exceeds balance current, the motor drives the pointer upscale and the potentiometer pickoff upscale to what is normally a higher voltage. The motor drives until the balance potentiometer voltage, applied to the FUEL REF (reference) capacitor and the GAGING COMPENSATOR, now also wetted, results in a nulling current at the amplifier input. As the amplifier input approaches null, the motor slows the eventually stops as the amplifier input sensitivity limit is reached, ideally at null.

The F (full) potentiometer of the bridge transformer applies a fixed, but adjustable, Voltage to one end of the balance potentiometer. In a properly adjusted System, the Voltage which produces the nulling current appears on the balance potentiometer at a di al graduation that represents the actual weight of fuel in the tank. Empty, full and tank unit (TU) adjustments correct for manufacturing and installation tolerances of indicators, tank units, compensators and wiring. Empty (E) and Full (F) are line adjustments, but only if this indicator is u Sed in an airplane Without a precalibrated indicator System.
The precalibrated system indicator has standardized shop-set adjustments. The airplane's tank unit network is "trimmed" to the precalibrated indicator.
The currents arriving at an amplifier input, nulling point, from the sensing side and balance (Qr reference) side of a bridge circuit are, ideally, 1800 out-of-phase for null ing to occur. A res istor is in each wire to a capacitor or capacitor network to reconcile power-factor differences, to reduce unequal shifting of Current and voltage phase angles due to the reactance differences and changes. These resistors also play a part in fault current limiting. An example of this phase - shift effect (called quadrature) is when, at the servo motor, the amplifier phase does not lead or lag the reference phase enough to develop the necessary driving torque. Note that contaminated fuel, fuel tank, tank units or compensators can become "resistors" and change current and power factor too. The contamination is usually water.
Water, seldom pure, acts more like an electrolyte than a die lectric, shorting or shunting the tank mounted capacitors and connectors. Water usually causes an obvious gage response (off-scale high or low, no response, slow response) and usually before other water related problems develop (corrosion, engine flame-out, etc...). A hidden characteristic of water is that as ice, the Dielectric Constant is approximately 2, nearly the same as fuel. Ice could be building up unnoticed in the fuel tanks. Pure water has a Dielectric Constant, K=80 approximately. If water is between the plates of the tank units or compensators, it has an effect 40 times greater than fuel covering the same plate area. An additional problem caused by contamination is that a fueling valve may not open for fueling or may not close automatically when the tank is full.

i. The servo motor is coupled to the balance potentiometer
and dial pointer through a speed reducer geared assembly. This minimizes Cycling of the indication due to over travel, fuel slosh and wave action, but allows the indicator to respond, without lag, to the fastest fuel quantity changes, as during fueling, defueling or dumping. The gear train contains a clutch that slips if the servo drives the pointer above or below the dial scale ends. During maintenance, when certain connectors are open, while the indicator is powered, causes the pointer to be driven to the Stops. Prolonged maintenance operations require the circuit breaker(s) to be pulled to prevent clutch and indicator damage.
j. When fuel is added to the tank, the current developed in the par allel circuit o the fuel reference and GAGING COMPENSATOR capacitors is biased by the effect of fuel in the Compensator. This causes the current on both sides of the bridge to change the same amount by fuel-composition caused Dielectric Constant deviations.
k . Ideally, the effect of fuel deviation in the tank units
is nulled by the effect in the gaging compensator. This is often referred to as density compensation, descriptive but not technically correct.
l. When the bridge is nulled, the balance potentiometer
voltage is an equivalent (analog) of tank quantity. This voltage is sent to the REPEATER INDICATOR on the fueling panel (Pl5). This voltage signal is also used for total fuel quantity indication, if instal led. TOTAL FUEL QUANTITY INDICATOR (s) are optional. Total fuel indication is a feature of the performance data computer system, another optional System.
m. The "repeater" indicator measures the "master" indicator
balance potentiometer voltage analog of fuel weight. The mating connector at the fueling panel changes the indicator mode from what is basically a capacitance meter in the Flight Engineer's panel (P4) to a cCapacitor-coupled bridge-type voltmeter. As a repeater, the F (full) potentiometer is set as required to make the repeater read the same as the master indicator. The E (empty) potentiometer has no function in the repeater mode. Ideally, if the repeater F potentiometer was adjusted with the master indicator on empty (zero) the repeater dial pointer would not move. For "fly-away spares" purposes the repeater indicator Could be adjusted as if it is the master, then reinstalled in the fueling panel without further adjustment. Acceptable repeater accuracy should exist since there is no empty adjust capability.

Test switches check indicator operation depending on the modes of the system, nonfueling or fueling. The FUEL QTY TEST (P4) circuit in the Fight Engineer's parie is inhibited during fueling, i.e.: FUELING POWER TRANSFER RELAY (R5) energized. In a nonfueling mode, the Engineer's panel test switch causes a short circuit of the voltage applied to the tank units.
4. Fuel Summation Unit
ӑ.
The Fuel Summation Unit provides a total fuel weight proportional voltage analog to the Performance Data Computer System (PDCS, ATA-34-18). The PDCS drives cursors ("bugs") and digital counters of the Engine Pressure Ratio indicators and airspeed indicators to assist the pilots in obtaining optimum performance efficiency for conditions and modes along the flight path. The PDCS Control Display Unit can indicate total fuel and other useful information as required. Total fuel weight voltage is used by the PDCS Computer to der ive airplane gross weight related data and rate-of-fuel burn related data. (The fuel flow meters do not input the PDCS.)
The Fuel Summation Unit uses an amplifier to measure the output of a parallel-current-summing network. Each input channel of the Summation circuit is line-adjusted, so that the current in a channel is proportional to the total current from the network in the same ratio that an individual tank capaccity is in proportion to the sum of the capacities of all tanks. For example, if one tank changes fuel weight, the "master" and total fuel indication should change the same number of weight units. The empty adjustment (E) is line-adjusted to correct for any zero volts/Zero weight discrepancies in the "mla Ster" in di Cat Or S .
The amplifier output, sent to the PDCS computer, is proportional to total fuel and, of course, bus-voltage. Therefore a second amplifier sends a compensating bus-voltage proportional reference to the PDCS computer. The summation unit has input channels for optionally installed auxiliary tanks. Unused input pins must be grounded.

5. Measur ing Sticks (Dripsticks)
a. The measuring sticks are graduated fiberglass tubes
Stowed in adapters in the tank bottom/wing lower skin. Tnaks No. 1 and No. 3 have four dripsticks each. Tank No. 2 has one in the right hand section. The sticks are located by a red circle around the Seal ing/lock ing head and tank No. 1 and No. 3 sticks are numbered, in board to outboard, No. 1 through No. 4. Tank No. 1 and No. 3 dripSticks No. 2, No. 3 and No. 4 are instal led in indexed tank access panel S.
b. When the dripstick is unlocked and Slowly lowered, fuel
will appear at the drip-hole in the Seal ing/lock ing head stem when the upper end submerges into the fuel. The dripstick scale is read at the flat surface inside the Stowage receptacle. Utilizing the appropriate tabales, the amount of fuel can be determined. A secondary use of the dripsticks is to obtain fuel samples other than at the sump drain valves. It is possible to take stratified samples. For example: specific weight averaging measurements. The dripsticks are graduated in inches with 0.2 inch subdivisions. The weight sticks have non-linear scales with subdivisions as required.
c. . To read the dripsticks and use the tables, the airplane
ground angle of pitch and roll must be known, the airplane must not be rocking or flexing and fueling agitation must have stopped. The tables are used to correct for ground attitude effects. Also, they correct for wing bending due to differential thermal expansion between upper and lower wing structure for tanks No. 1 and 3.
d. The tables convert the inch-dripsticks to fuel volume
units. Volume units are coverted to weight units by computation using the fuel specific weight. The weight-unit dripstick readings must be corrected by Computation if the fuel Specific weight is other tham 6. 7 pounds per U.S. gallon (or equivalents: 3.039 Kg/USG, 0.8029 Kg/liter, 8.046/pounds/ - imperial gallon) .
e. The dripsticks in tank No. 1 and No. 3 have considerable overlap of reading levels. At least two sticks are read and compared to provide for correction of differential thermal expansion wing bending error. Tank No. 2 dripstick is unus able at or near full tank volumes at most usual ground angles, as it is submerged. Some of tank No. 1 and No. 3 dripsticks may be submerged at certian ground angles and fuel volumes.
f. Use of the dripsticks requires careful consideration so
that unjustified doubt of the Fuel Quantity Indication System does not result. Although the dripsticks are simple devices they have their own limitations in being able to locate the true fuel surface. Consider the possible effect of the baffle check valves. When a dripstick is fully extended and stopped against the adapter, a large amount of fuel is not measurable.
