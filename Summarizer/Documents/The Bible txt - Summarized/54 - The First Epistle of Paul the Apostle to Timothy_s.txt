3:13 For they that have used the office of a deacon well purchase to themselves a good degree, and great boldness in the faith which is in Christ Jesus.
And, The labourer is worthy of his reward.
2:5 For there is one God, and one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus; 
2:6 Who gave himself a ransom for all, to be testified in due time.
