The General Epistle of Jude
1:1 Jude, the servant of Jesus Christ, and brother of James, to them that are sanctified by God the Father, and preserved in Jesus Christ, and called: 
1:2 Mercy unto you, and peace, and love, be multiplied.
1:4 For there are certain men crept in unawares, who were before of old ordained to this condemnation, ungodly men, turning the grace of our God into lasciviousness, and denying the only Lord God, and our Lord Jesus Christ.
1:8 Likewise also these filthy dreamers defile the flesh, despise dominion, and speak evil of dignities.
