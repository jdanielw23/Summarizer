7:2 Receive us; we have wronged no man, we have corrupted no man, we have defrauded no man.
5:11 Knowing therefore the terror of the Lord, we persuade men; but we are made manifest unto God; and I trust also are made manifest in your consciences.
11:18 Seeing that many glory after the flesh, I will glory also.
