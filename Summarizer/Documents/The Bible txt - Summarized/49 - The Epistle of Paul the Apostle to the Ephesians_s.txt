6:23 Peace be to the brethren, and love with faith, from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
4:4 There is one body, and one Spirit, even as ye are called in one hope of your calling; 
4:5 One Lord, one faith, one baptism, 
4:6 One God and Father of all, who is above all, and through all, and in you all.
5:32 This is a great mystery: but I speak concerning Christ and the church.
