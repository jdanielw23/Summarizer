1:7 For we have great joy and consolation in thy love, because the bowels of the saints are refreshed by thee, brother.
1:8 Wherefore, though I might be much bold in Christ to enjoin thee that which is convenient, 
1:9 Yet for love's sake I rather beseech thee, being such an one as Paul the aged, and now also a prisoner of Jesus Christ.
1:20 Yea, brother, let me have joy of thee in the Lord: refresh my bowels in the Lord.
