10:42 And all these kings and their land did Joshua take at one time, because the LORD God of Israel fought for Israel.
24:21 And the people said unto Joshua, Nay; but we will serve the LORD.
22:25 For the LORD hath made Jordan a border between us and you, ye children of Reuben and children of Gad; ye have no part in the LORD: so shall your children make our children cease from fearing the LORD.
