2:19 For I through the law am dead to the law, that I might live unto God.
2:20 I am crucified with Christ: neverthless I live; yet not I, but Christ liveth in me: and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself for me.
3:20 Now a mediator is not a mediator of one, but God is one.
