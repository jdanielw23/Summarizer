3:9 For behold the stone that I have laid before Joshua; upon one stone shall be seven eyes: behold, I will engrave the graving thereof, saith the LORD of hosts, and I will remove the iniquity of that land in one day.
14:9 And the LORD shall be king over all the earth: in that day shall there be one LORD, and his name one.
