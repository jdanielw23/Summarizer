3:11 Now God himself and our Father, and our Lord Jesus Christ, direct our way unto you.
4:14 For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so them also which sleep in Jesus will God bring with him.
5:18 In every thing give thanks: for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus concerning you.
