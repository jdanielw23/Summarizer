3:3  For ye are dead, and your life is hid with Christ in God.
2:8  Beware lest any man spoil you through philosophy and vain deceit, after the tradition of men, after the rudiments of the world, and not after Christ.
3:1  If ye then be risen with Christ, seek those things which are above, where Christ sitteth on the right hand of God.
