Now therefore are we all here present before God, to hear all things that are commanded thee of God.
23:1 And Paul, earnestly beholding the council, said, Men and brethren, I have lived in all good conscience before God until this day.
26:6 And now I stand and am judged for the hope of the promise made of God, unto our fathers: 
26:7 Unto which promise our twelve tribes, instantly serving God day and night, hope to come.
