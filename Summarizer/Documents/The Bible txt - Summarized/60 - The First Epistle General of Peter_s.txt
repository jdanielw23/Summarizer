2:19 For this is thankworthy, if a man for conscience toward God endure grief, suffering wrongfully.
4:10 As every man hath received the gift, even so minister the same one to another, as good stewards of the manifold grace of God.
4:11 If any man speak, let him speak as the oracles of God; if any man minister, let him do it as of the ability which God giveth: that God in all things may be glorified through Jesus Christ, to whom be praise and dominion for ever and ever.
